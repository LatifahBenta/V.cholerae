# V.cholerae

*Vibrio cholerae* is a Gram-negative bacterium known for it's ability to colonize the human intestinal tract and cause cholera, a severe diarrheal disease. This bacterium has been responsible for 7 global pandemics, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is estimated that cholera causes approximately 100,000 deaths annually. V.cholerae is spread through ingestion of contaminated water or food. Upon reaching the intestine, the bacterium produces cholera toxin, which leads to profuse watery diarrhea- a hallmark symptom of cholera. A lot of progress has been made in phenotypically characterizing V.cholerae, however, there remains a critical need to understand the pathogen at a molecular level. Molecular insights into V.cholerae will be essential for developing targeted interventions , including vaccines and antimicrobial therapies. Here we aim to:
