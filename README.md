# V.cholerae

*Vibrio cholerae* is a Gram-negative bacterium known for it's ability to colonize the human intestinal tract and cause cholera, a severe diarrheal disease. This bacterium has been responsible for 7 global pandemics, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is estimated that cholera is responsible for approximately 100,000 deaths annually. *V.cholerae* is spread through ingestion of contaminated water or food. Upon reaching the intestine, the bacterium produces cholera toxin, which leads to profuse watery diarrhea- a hallmark symptom of cholera. A lot of progress has been made in phenotypically characterizing *V.cholerae*, however, there remains a critical need to understand the pathogen at a molecular level. Molecular insights into *V.cholerae* will be essential for developing targeted interventions , including vaccines and antimicrobial therapies. Here we aim to do:
* Genomic characterization on *V. cholerae*

   * Conduct comparative genomics to pinpoint key virulence factors and regulatory elements.

   * Sequence diverse Vibrio cholerae genomes to identify genetic variations linked to pathogenicity and epidemic potential.

* Antibiotic Resistance and Molecular Epidemiology

   * Examine genetic determinants of antibiotic resistance in circulating Vibrio cholerae strains.

    * Analyze molecular epidemiology to understand cholera transmission dynamics and strain evolution.

    From our study these are our expected outcomes:

  * Enhanced understanding of *V. cholerae* pathogenesis and adaptation.
 
  * Insights into cholera epidemiology for guiding public health startegies.
