# *V.cholerae*

*Vibrio cholerae* is a Gram-negative bacterium known for it's ability to colonize the human intestinal tract and cause cholera, a severe diarrheal disease. This bacterium has been responsible for 7 global pandemics, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is estimated that cholera is responsible for approximately 100,000 deaths annually. *V.cholerae* is spread through ingestion of contaminated water or food. Upon reaching the intestine, the bacterium produces cholera toxin, which leads to profuse watery diarrhea- a hallmark symptom of cholera. A lot of progress has been made in phenotypically characterizing *V.cholerae*, however, there remains a critical need to understand the pathogen at a molecular level. Molecular insights into *V.cholerae* will be essential for developing targeted interventions , including vaccines and antimicrobial therapies. Here we aim to Genomically characterize *V.cholerae* and it's phylogenomics over time. To achieve our primary objective, we want to do the following on *V.cholerae* isolates:

  * For Genomic characterizations

     * Strain typing

    * Serotyping

    * Resistome and pathogenicity factors

    * CTX phage characterization (Extraction of prophage genome and genomic characterization of AMR and virulence factors)

     * Characterization of Mobile Genetic Elements in Cholera

  
* Phylogenomics

   * Create phylogenetic  trees to understand evolutionary history and infer the current to future changes of *V. cholerae* over time


From our study, these are our expected outcomes:

* Enhanced understanding of *V. cholerae* pathogenesis and adaptation.
 
* Insights into cholera epidemiology for guiding public health startegies.
